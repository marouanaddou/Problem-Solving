This repository contains a C++ solution for the "Greatest Common Divisor of Strings" problem. 
The solution applies the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), typically used in number theory, to strings. 
The essence of the problem is to find the longest string that can be used to construct two given strings by repeated concatenation.
