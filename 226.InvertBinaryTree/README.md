Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]

Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27e391a-61fa-4318-babf-ca876cd29f61)

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: [2,3,1]

Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
